# JPG/PNG/JPEG to PDF Project

## Description:

This project is built to help me convert the images that are scanned to submit my math assignments during the quarantine period. I was motivated to develop this project because most of the online pdf converter platforms actually limit the number of times of converting the uploaded images into pdf files.

## Tools Used:

-  ReactJS
-  NodeJS
-  HTML
-  CSS
-  ImageMagick
-  React-Beautiful-DND
-  Heroku
-  Netlify
